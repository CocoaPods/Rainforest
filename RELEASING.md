### Releasing CocoaPods

#### Environment Setup

Make sure to follow any initial setup instructions specified in the [README.md](README.md).

1. Clone [Strata](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Strata)
2. Run `rake clone` to setup the [Strata](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Strata) repo and all of its submodules.
3. Clone [Rainforest](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Rainforest).
4. Run through Rainforest [README](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Rainforest/blob/master/README.md) to setup the repo and all of its submodules. Note that this may take a while.
5. Run `gem install postit`.
6. Setup `options.yml` configuration file:
    1. Include option for `strata` pointing to your Strata repo.
    2. Include option for `branch_prefix` to be used then making a release.
    2. Include paths to [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org) & [Bundler](https://bundler.io) if releasing [Molinillo](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo).

Example `options.yml` file:
```yaml
---
  strata: '~/Development/Strata'
  branch_prefix: 'dnkoutso/'
  rubygems: '~/Development/rubygems' # Optional unless a Molinillo release is required.
  bundler: '~/Development/bundler' # Optional unless a Molinillo release is required.
```

7. Install `gh` CLI tool via `brew install gh` and run `gh auth login`.
8. Make sure [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org) is setup to your GitHub [account](https://github.com/settings/keys) keys.
9. Get access to the gems you want to publish on [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
10. It is a good idea to run `bundle install` within the [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) to ensure [Bundler](https://bundler.io) can be configured successfully.

#### Executing A Release

1. If your release includes [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) then open a PR that runs `bundle update cocoapods`. Ensure the build passes and is merged. This ensures CocoaPods will work with the new releases of all its dependencies that are about to be released.
2. Run `rake status` to help you figure out which gems need a release.
3. Run `rake pull` to update all repos (after checking out `master` on all of them).
4. Run `rake topological_order > topological_order.txt`.
5. For each gem you want to release, in topological order (go from the top of `topological_order.txt` to the bottom), run:
    1. Check formatting of latest release in the `CHANGELOG.md`.
    2. Install and use the latest Ruby version used by the gem you are releasing.
    3. Ensure the git config of the gem's repo is set to the account you are publishing with. Use `git config user.name "John Doe"` and `git config user.email johndoe@example.com`.
    4. Run `rake super_release:[REPO_NAME, VERSION]` (e.g. `rake super_release\[Core,1.7.0\]`.
    5. If `super_release` _fails_ for a gem then do the following:
        1. `cd` into the gem directory that failed.
        2. Run `git reset --hard`.
        3. Get the failure fixed, and start over.
